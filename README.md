We believe that a major impediment to rescue operations involved in major natural disasters like foods,avalanches,landslides,earthquakes, forest fires etc is an absence of proper data available to rescue forces about the whereabout of people gravely affected and the amount of suferrers.We want to solve this issue, and to provide the rescue operation teams ample data to strategize their rescue operation, and to locate and help many more affected individuals(whose whereabouts are not known and hence they are not rescued in time).We plan to make a web app which will be helpful in finding the people who are in danger at the times of natural disaster. The app would collect the geolocation of the individuals and present the data coherently to the rescue teams, so that they are able to properly strategize and appropritelely coordinate the rescue operations, and also that those individuals who are affected at remote/unknown to other locations also are able to present thier location, and hence stand a chance of being rescued. The team will get a map on which they will have the data about the location of each of the person who is in danger.
The app will also provide the people who are in danger with the ways to contact the teams that are on the way to help them. In the necessary cases (like forest fires, floods), the app will provide the information about the nearest safe place in terms of shelter or where food/utilities distribution is taking place(in the aftermath).The app will also have a few To-Dos uploaded to act appropriately when they are faced with siituations of the current natural disaster. All in all this app would become a single point source of geolocationing for the affected individuals, that would assist in rescue operation, and help affected individuals find safe places and pointers and ToDo associated with surviving a natural disaster.
